# Security+ Lab Environment Overview

## Objective

The purpose of this lab environment is to create a controlled attack-and-defense
simulation setup that supports hands-on learning aligned with CompTIA Security+.

This environment will be used to:

- Perform network scans
- Capture and analyze packets
- Generate authentication logs
- Simulate reconnaissance (gathering target intel before an attack) activity
- Practice defensive log analysis

## Lab Architecture

The lab will consist of:

- Kali Linux (Attacker / Analysis Machine)
- Windows 10 (Victim / Log Generation Machine)

Both systems will run inside VirtualBox and communicate within a controlled
virtual network.

## Host System Specifications

- Host OS: Windows
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: ~140GB free (expandable)
- Virtualization Platform: VirtualBox

## Security Relevance

Understanding both offensive and defensive techniques is critical for SOC analysts.
This lab enables practical understanding of how malicious activity appears at
the network and system level, preparing for real-world monitoring scenarios.
